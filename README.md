Create a project with Angular latest version and install the packages you need, install the PrimeNg UI framework so you can design faster.
It’s enough as long as it has a tidy appearance, functionality is more important to us.
First, use the PrimeNg “Steps” component or design a wizard, it’s quite up to you then we need our form component to include 4 steps.
-         	Step one upload an image
-         	Step two designs a form that has fields below
•        	Valid amount (only accept numbers)
•        	Valid date (only the next 5 days can be selected)
•        	Status (which is a dropdown with 4 options)
•        	Source of fund (Input that accepts only letters)
-         	Step three a table of people and we should be able to select one person from the table and then move to the last step.
-         	Step four shows just a summary of the last three steps
Each step must have a separate component.
It is better to transfer data between components by Ngrx but it is not necessary.
After completing the coding step please push it to your GitHub and share the link to review that.
Good luck!
